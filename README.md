# Lost
#### Lost is a programming language I created for the thrill of it! The language is inspired by Lua, Python, Pascal, and Java. I took what I liked from those languages and implemented it in Lost. Like any other language, Lost is inspired by English and is made and run using Python.

Lost was created with simplicity in mind, and the main idea was to write programs with a small amount of code. The idea came to me two years ago when I wanted to create a programming language that makes GUI creation easier. I hated that you had to write a lot of code just to make a simple window, so I thought of creating a language that requires only a few lines to create something. I haven't implemented the gui library yet and I will do that when fully done with the programming language

The naming of the language was fairly easy since I loved how "Lost" makes the language sound mysterious and cool. Additionally, I go by the name Lost in many other places, so I wanted the language to inherit the name.

I wouldin't say this language is complete but it is able to perform simple prototypes

Here is an example of the lost programming language:
```rust
lost.begin
    // Assign a value to a variable
    my_var = "Hello, World!";
    
    // Write the value of the variable
    write(my_var);
    
    // Ask for user input and assign it to a variable
    user_input = ask("Enter something: ");
    write("You entered: " + user_input);
    
    // Conditional statements
    if 5 > 3 then
        write("5 is greater than 3");
    else then
        write("This will not be printed");
lost.end
```
###### Lost was created by hislost and it's an interpreted language made in python making the language slow, but the language will soon be made faster using cpython and other optimisers, making it either as fast as python, slightly slower or faster than python.
