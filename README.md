# The-lost-programming-language
the lost programming language is a custom programming language I created for fun! I added features I loved in language I liked working with like python, java, lua and pascal. The lost programming language is a programming language inspired by alot of English syntax, making it easy to learn for English speakers.

How to print "hello world" using the lost language?
printing hello world using the lost language is as simple as just writing 
```c++
write("hello world")
```
###### write is used for printing string

Input then?
well inputing is just as easy if not easier. All you need to do is to type:
```c++
ask("question: ")
```
###### ask is used for inputing, allowing user interaction
