# üíª Welcome to the lost programming language üöÄ
## Introduction üìñ
Lost is a dynamic and versatile programming language designed with simplicity and creativity in mind. It's perfect for those who love to learn and explore the world of coding. The language is inspired by Lua, Python, Pascal, and Java. I took what I liked from those languages and implemented it in Lost. Like any other language, Lost is inspired by English and it is also made and run using Python.
## History üìú
Lost was created with simplicity in mind, and the main idea was to write programs with a small amount of code. The idea came to me two years ago when I wanted to create a programming language that makes GUI creation easier. I hated that you had to write a lot of code just to make a simple window, so I thought of creating a language that requires only a few lines to create something. Currently I'm planning to make

The naming of the language was fairly easy since I loved how "Lost" makes the language sound mysterious and cool. Additionally, I go by the name Lost in many other places, so I wanted the language to inherit the name.

I wouldin't say this language is complete but it is able to perform simple prototypes

## Language Examples: üóÇÔ∏è
```rust
lost.begin
// Assign a value to a variable
my_var = "Hello, World!";
    
// Write the value of the variable
write(my_var);
    
// Ask for user input and assign it to a variable
user_input = ask("Enter something: ");
write("You entered: " + user_input);
    
// Conditional statements
if 5 > 3 then
    write("5 is greater than 3");
else then
    write("This will not be printed");
lost.end
```
###### Example 2 üóÇÔ∏è
```rust
lost.begin
// printing name register
write("Name register");

// Assign a value to a variable
names = 0;

// Write the value of the variable
write("Amouth of names: ", names);

// Ask for user input and assign it to a variable
name = ask("What is your name: ");
age = ask("What is your age: ");

// conditional statements
if name.is "lost" then
    write("thats the name of the language");
    names = names + 1;
    write("Amouth of names: ", names);
    write("So your name is ", name, ", and you are ", age, " years old. Wow, thats cool ", name);
else then
    names = names + 1;
    write("Amouth of names: ", names);
    write("So your name is ", name, " and you are ", age, " years old. Wow, thats cool ", name);
lost.end
```
